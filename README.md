# Google Maps
Embedding Google map in a webpage via latitude and longitude values provided through input. With the click of a button, the latitude and longitude GPS values will be used to search for the place via Google Maps. Initially, validation will take place to ensure that both fields catering for latitude and longitude values are complete. The map is subsequently embedded into the placeholder upon button click.

This solution has been designed and developed using HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript! I might take jQuery into consideration in the future, as well as plugins such as Driver.js.
